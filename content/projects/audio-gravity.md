# audio-gravity

Audio Gravity is a Processing sketch implementing a gravitational particle system which reacts in real-time to an user-inputed song.

At each instant, this sketch places a number of gravitational particles in a three-dimensional space and binds each of them to a particular audio frequency. As the song plays, a gravitational simulation is computed in real time in which the gravitational constant for each particle is modulated by the contribution of this particle's frequency to the current waveform.
