# Cosmos

> "Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe" by Alexander Von Humboldt is a beautiful book which was highly influential at its time (the five volumes were published between 1845 and 1862), but which has became growingly inaccessible.

> Intending to make Humboldt's masterpiece accessible for modern audiences, I have edited it in LaTeX starting from a OCR transcription of a scan of a very old English translation of the, book by  Elise C. Otte. I illustrated the book with images in the public domain or with permissive licenses from Wikimedia Commons.

> There is a lot of work to be done yet, but I'm releasing the first 26 chapters of the first volume here. I'm open to typo corrections and suggestions in general.
